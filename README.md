## Problem Statement

The algorithm aims to use quantization techniques to identify common patterns and features within video frames, grouping frames together into segments. The goal is to achieve accurate and efficient segmentation usable in applications like video editing, surveillance, and content-based video retrieval. The challenge is to design a robust and scalable algorithm to handle the complexity of real-world videos and provide meaningful segmentation that reflects underlying video structure.

Additionally, the existing implementation of the `ContentDetector` feature in the SceneDetect library erroneously includes the last frame of the next shot in detected shots. The goal is to modify the code to overcome this issue. We also seek to integrate the YOLO algorithm for object detection to enable semantic shot-to-scene grouping.

**Objectives:**
- Fix shot-boundary detection errors in SceneDetect.
- Integrate YOLO for semantic understanding of each shot.
- Group shots into scenes based on detection results.

## Implementation

### YOLO (You Only Look Once)

- **YOLO** is an object detection algorithm that divides an image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class labels for each cell.
- It is a single-stage detector, predicting all bounding boxes and classes in a single pass.

#### YOLO Architecture

- Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
- **CNN layers:** Extract visual features such as edges and shapes.
- **Fully connected layers:** Classify features and predict bounding boxes and class labels.

### Backend

- Database Migrations
    ```bash
    go run main.go
    # Sample output:
    # 00001_users.sql ...
    # 00002_sessions.sql ...
    # 00003_password_reset.sql ...
    ```
- Sign Up, Password Hash, Session Tokens, Login, Forgot Password, Password Reset, and Cookies.

## Conclusion and Future Enhancements

### Conclusion

Video segmentation using quantization is promising due to its simplicity, efficiency, and flexibility. Clustering video features leads to meaningful segmentations without prior knowledge of content, making it suitable for video editing, surveillance, and summarization.

### Future Enhancements

- **Domain Adaptation:** Enable the model to adapt to new datasets without manual annotation.
- **Emotion-aware Segmentation:** Incorporate facial expressions, tone, or body language into the quantization process for more accurate segmentation and emotion recognition.
